# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BRAZILLIAN_E-COMMERCE_DATA_ANALYSIS

I completed a power bi project in collaboration with UNP(United Network of Professionals) The data set is Brazilian e commerce data.This project presents a comprehensive Brazilian E-Commerce Data Analysis dashboard developed using Power BI. The report analyzes key business metrics including total revenue (13.59M), total orders (99K), customer distribution, and average review score (4.09). It provides detailed insights into revenue trends, product category performance, payment analysis, and order delivery efficiency. The dashboard highlights customer concentration across states, payment preferences, and late delivery patterns. Interactive filters allow users to explore data by year, customer state, and payment type. Key problems such as credit card dependency and uneven sales distribution are identified along with strategic recommendations. This project demonstrates strong skills in data visualization, KPI analysis, and business intelligence reporting.
